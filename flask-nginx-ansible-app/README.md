# Deploy Flask app 

This project demonstrates how to deploy a Flask (Python) app using Ansible, behind an Nginx server, to a VPS of choice (here, an Ubuntu VPS).

This project borrows greatly from the blog at: http://mattupstate.com/blog/flask-wsgi-application-deployment-with-ubuntu-ansible-nginx-supervisor-and-uwsgi/

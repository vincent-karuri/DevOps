# Bake custom AMI using Ansible, Packer and Terraform


This project demonstrates how to launch a custom AMI that is built using Packer, configured using Ansible and deployed / provisioned using Terraform.

Nginx is used as the demo web server.

This follows along from this [tutorial](https://itnext.io/immutable-infrastructure-using-packer-ansible-and-terraform-7ca6f79582b8) and this [code](https://github.com/MiteshSharma/ImmutableInfrastructure). 

Special thanks to the original author!

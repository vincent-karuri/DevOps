# Deploy Python App

This project contains two sets of playbooks. 

One set spins up an Ubuntu VM on Azure.

The other set provisions the machine and deploys a Python application on it.

The project largely follows along from: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/ansible-create-complete-vm
and https://tdhopper.com/blog/automating-python-with-ansible/.
